[ModuleInformation(Description=
    @"This module provides one of the basic types of purposes used by GTAModel. 
An assignment purpose is similar to any in a four step model however the generation and distribution 
step have been fused since they work at an individual agent level. The AssignmentPurpose module takes 
in an IAssignment sub-module, a list of IDemographicCategory modules and an IUtilityModifyModeSplit module.
This module requires the root module of the model system to be an ‘I4StepModel’." )]
